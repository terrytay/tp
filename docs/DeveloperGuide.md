### 2.2. Task Component  
  

[comment]: # (@@author GanapathySanathBalaji)  
  
The Task component depends on 3 other components,   
  
 1. Command Component - The Command component issues instructions for the Task component to execute based on the user's input.  
 
 2. UI Component - The UI component is used to display the results (and related exceptions) of the commands issued to the Task Component. 
 
 3. ResourceLoader Component - The ResourceLoader component is used to load the list of tasks stored previously when the application is started and is also used to store the current list of tasks to the local storage upon exit.   

![Task Component](images/TaskComponentUML.png)   
<div>Figure 2. Class Diagram for Task Component</div>
<br>
The task component contains 8 separate classes. They are as follows:  
 
  1. Task: Abstract class used to model a generic task. 
   
  2. Event: Specialized task class used to model events.  
  
  3. Deadline: Specialized task class used to model a deadline.   
   
  4. TaskType: Enumeration class used to denote the various task types.   
  
  5. TaskList: Container class used to store the list of tasks and handle related operations. 
   
  6. SchedulableTask: Class used to model a task that is scheduled based on user's requirements.  
  
  7. TaskComparator: Contains a custom comparator used to compare two schedulable tasks based on their 
  numberOfDaysLeft attribute.  
  
  8. TaskScheduler: Class used to check for feasibility and schedule a list of tasks based on the user's requirements.

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1. Scheduling Tasks 


[comment]: # (@@author GanapathySanathBalaji)

#### 3.1.1 Implementation 
   In order to schedule tasks based on the user's requirement a separate SchedulableTask class was created. 
 1. The user's requirements (Name, Time to complete it, Deadline) are captured for each of the tasks to be scheduled. 
 1. The requirements captured are stored in the SchedulableTask object. 
 1. Then, the TaskScheduler object finds the optimum schedule based on the user's requirements using the EDF 
 (Early Deadline First) algorithm.
 1. If a feasible schedule is found it is displayed, else a message stating that a schedule based on the user's requirements can't be made is displayed.
 
	
   The following sequence diagrams explain how tasks are scheduled.
	
 ![Overall Sequence Diagram](images/ScheduleOverall.png)
<div>Figure 5. Overall Sequence Diagram</div>
<br>
 The three reference frames used are as follows:

 * `Get information regarding the tasks from the user`

 ![Sub Diagram 1](images/ScheduleSub1.png)
 <div>Figure 6. Sub Diagram 1</div>
 <br>
 
 * `Check and Schedule tasks if feasible`

 ![Sub Diagram 2](images/ScheduleSub2.png)
 <div>Figure 7. Sub Diagram 2</div>
 <br>
 
 * `Add the scheduled tasks to the current list of tasks`
 
 ![Sub Diagram 3](images/ScheduleSub3.png)
 <div>Figure 8. Sub Diagram 3</div>
 <br> 
 
#### 3.1.2 Alternatives
Aspect: How to capture the user's requirements and handle them.

 - Alternative 1 (Current Choice) : Create a separate SchedulableTask object to store the user's requirements for each task 
                                    to be scheduled.
      - Pros: New class objects can be customised without affecting the core functionality of the product if the attributes provided by 
      the user (to tasks to be scheduled) changes.
      - Cons: New methods similar to previously implemented methods have to be created instead of being reused.
      
 - Alternative 2: Modify existing event or deadline class to model the user's requirements.
      - Pros: It reuses methods and reduces coupling between classes in the TaskComponent.
      - Cons: Major changes would be required throughout various components of the application to accommodate the new feature. 

     Finally, the first alternative was implemented as it was easier to implement and maintain it if changes were required to 
the user's requirements (e.g. Changes to the number of parameters provided by the user). 

#### 3.1.3 Future Enhancements

The current version of the application doesn't take into account the other tasks present, however, the priority 
values can still be used to decide the more important task. <br>
In v3.0 our application will support
 1. scheduling tasks while avoiding tasks present previously 
 1. add support for tasks to be scheduled preemptively (i.e, tasks can be scheduled over non-contiguous days)
 1. Change the default priority value assigned to scheduled tasks

### 3.2. Listing Study Areas 

#### 3.2.1 Implementation 
The Study Area search is facilitated by StudyAreaList. In this class, it has the list of all existing Study Areas, 
stored internally as an ArrayList. This ArrayList is called studyAreaList. 

To list the Study Area, we iterate through the entire list of all existing Study Area and conduct a check. The check is 
as follows :

If in each Study Area, the Study Area meets all the flags stated by the User, the Study Area is then added to the 
list of available Study Area. If not, the iteration is skipped and move on to the subsequent Study Area.

To do as mentioned above, the StudyAreaList class implements the following main methods :

- searchList() : 
    - This method will iterate through all the Study Areas in the ArrayList studyAreaList while calling other methods 
    to fulfil the search requirements. Once process has ended, the method will return a list of the Study Area, availStudyArea, 
    that meets the User requirement.
- getFlagsInfo() : 
    - This method will retrieve the flags entered by User, at the same time validating the User input. The criteria 
    entered by the User will be returned as flags, an Array of Strings of fixed size 5 as the software only supports 5 
    flags in version 2.
- isAvailStudyArea() : 
    - This method does the check mentioned above and returns a boolean value. Based on the flags detected, 
    the method will iterate through the flags array and check if the Study Area's attribute match each flag stated in
    flags. If isAvailStudyArea returns as true for all flags, the Study Area is then added to the output list, 
    availStudyArea. 

Below would be a sequence diagram to demonstrate how the search algorithm is operated.

 * `User enters search key` 
 
![Study Area Sequence_Diagram_Main](images/usersLinteraction.png)  
<div>Figure 9. Interaction between User and Study Area Search Interface</div>
<br>

 * `StudyAreaCommand invokes searchList() of StudyAreaList`

<div>Figure 11. Interaction when isAvailStudyArea is invoked</div>
<br>

You can refer [here](#appendix-d-glossary) for a detailed explanation on the terms used in this diagram

#### 3.2.2 Alternative 
Aspect: How to search based on User input.

- Alternative 1 (Current Choice) :
 
    Iterate through the list of all existing Study Areas. Then check if each Study Area meets User's Criteria
    - Pros: Lesser data structures required. Therefore lesser memory required.
    - Cons: Linear search, therefore, with a bigger size of data, the search may take longer. <br>

    
- Alternative 2 : 


There exist four flags: port availability, indoor, outdoor, capacity. Create adjacency lists that map the flag to the 
Study Area itself. If the Study Area contains that attribute, the Study Area is added in that specific attribute list. 
Depending on the type of attribute, the adjacency list can be implemented using different data structures.


For example, let's take only the two study areas below as the entire data set.

![study_area_det](images/studyAreaDet.PNG)
<div>Figure 12. Sample Data</div>
<br>

This will result in the following adjacency lists : 

Environment: 

Indoor -> {Starbucks} <br>
Outdoor -> {Opposite Town Green (Outside Starbucks)} 

*Data Structure* : 2D Array, with only two rows (For indoors and outdoors)

Ports: 

Yes -> {Opposite Town Green (Outside Starbucks), Starbucks}<br>
No -> null

*Data Structure*: 2D Array, with only two rows (For Yes and No)

Capacity: 

4 -> {Opposite Town Green (Outside Starbucks)} <br>
5 -> {Starbucks} 

*Data Structure*: HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<String>> 

The creation and initialisation of the lists are done when the software is setting up.  Therefore, each flag 
has its designated list. Based on user criteria, concatenate an output list with the Study Areas that are found in all
of the relevant flag lists stated by the user. If more than one requirement is entered by the user, only the Study 
Areas appears in all the related attributes specified by the User will be added to the output list.

- Pros: Data is categorised based on flags.
- Cons: More memory is required as more data structures are used. Since methods invoked during the search are also 
linear, time taken to complete the search will be longer if more data are present. Overall, this approach is harder 
to implement.

Therefore, the first alternative is chosen, as it is much easier to implement and lesser memory is used while searching

### 3.3. Operation of Notes

#### 3.3.1 Implementation 

The NotesInvoker class will create a Notes object. Notes acts as an Interface for the ModulesList class.
Each module is mapped to an ArrayList of notes. This map is stored in the ModuleList class. The ModuleList class
contains operations to add, remove, enter and list modules.
<br>

A ModuleManager class is used to hold operations for a module. These operations are achieved by working together
with the Parser class and Command class. Operations supported are: add, list, undo, redo. 

Add operations are fairly simple, primarily using the add method of the HashMap library. The implementation of
undo and redo is stated here below.

Each time an AddCommand object is called, CommandStack will determine if the operation is add, undo or redo.
<br><br>
If the operation is to add notes, the notes will be added to the value in the module key. At the same time, 
this note that is added is also added to a CommandStack list in the CommandStack class. The redoStack list in the 
CommandStack class is then cleared.
<br><br>
If the operation is to undo added notes, the CommandStack will remove the last added note from
the CommandStack and pass it to the Command class to execute the undo action by removing it from the module
contained in the HashMap. Also, this note will be added to the redoStack list.
<br><br>
If the operation is to redo removed notes, the CommandStack will remove the last added note in redoStack list and
pass it to the Command class to execute the redo action by adding this note into the module contained in the
HashMap.
<br><br>
The reason why we chose two linked lists to support these operations is that it reduces the SLOC needed to
write the logic. An alternative is to actually remember the state of the HashMap before an operation and save
it to another HashMap. However, this approach will take up more memory and reduces the performance of the application.

## 4. Testing 

Currently, we have two runners to execute the tests, JUnit and Gradle.<br>
*Note*: It is advisable to run tests with coverage, to ensure that 90% of the paths are covered.


#### Using IntelliJ JUnit

Firstly check if the configuration, "All in 'tp.test'" exist. You need to edit a configuration if there isn't any to run all tests. 

To edit a configuration, click `Run` then click on `Edit Configurations`. Proceed to click the `+` icon, followed by `JUnit`

Afterward, ensure that the configurations are as such:

![Junit_config](images/JUnitConfiguration.PNG)
<div>Figure 13. Configuring JUnit Tests</div>
<br>

To run all tests, right-click on the src/test/java folder and choose Run 'All in 'tp.tests'' with coverage
This allows for you to see which path has the test covered so that you can ensure at least 90% of the paths are covered when testing.

Alternatively, you can click on this icon to run with coverage :

![JUnit_test](images/JUnitRunTest.PNG)
<div>Figure 14. Running JUnit Tests</div>
<br>


To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose Run with coverage.

#### Using Gradle

Firstly ensure that the Gradle build has the following details: 

![Gradle_build](images/gradleBuild.PNG)
<div>Figure 15. Expected Gradle Build </div>
<br>

Next, to run using Gradle, you can click on the Gradle plugin icon at the left-hand side

Then click on the elephant icon (as seen below) and search for `Gradle test` then proceed to click on it.

![elephant_icon](images/elephantIcon.PNG)
<div>Figure 16. Gradle Icon</div>
<br>

Now the configuration is set to Gradle. Proceed to click the icon:

![Gradle_run_test](images/gradleRunTest.PNG)

## Appendix D: Glossary    

 * *Mainstream OS* - Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
 * *priority* - Value used to indicate the importance of a task. The task with a higher priority value is considered to
 be more important
 * *EDF Algorithm* - **E**arliest **D**eadline **F**irst is a dynamic priority scheduling algorithm
 * *flag* - Criteria that are supported by the software. Currently supported flags are, -i for indoors, -o for outdoors,
 -p for Study Areas with ports and -s for the number of people that the Study Area should facilitate 
 * *available Study Area* - Study Areas that matches the User requirement, therefore _available_ for usage
 * *availStudyAreas* - ArrayList of StudyArea objects that contains the list of available Study Areas
 * *isAvail* - This is a boolean value returned by isAvailStudyArea. It returns as true if the either one of the alternate 
 paths in [the sequence diagram](#isAvail) returns a true value
 * *executeStudyCommand()* - This method executes the Study Area User Interface
 * *getHasPorts()* - This method returns true if the Study Area has a port, and false if otherwise
 * *getIsIndoor()* - This method returns true if the Study Area is indoors, and false if otherwise
 * *isSizeCapable()* - This method returns true if the maximum size of the Study Area is capable of containing the size stated
 by the user.<a name="containsSearchKey"></a>
 * *containsSearchKey()* - This method returns true if the Study Area's name, faculty or address contain the search key 
 entered by the user. This method is invoked when under the [default](#isAvail) condition as search by name, address or locations 
 does not require any flags, instead, it utilises a loose search 
 * *ports_flag* - refers to "-p" flag <a name="flags"></a>
 * *indoor_flag* - refers to "-i" flag
 * *outdoor_flag* - refers to "-o" flag
 * *size_flag* - refers to "-s" flag
 * *loadDictionary()* - this method will load the data for the mapping (of loose search terms to name/address/faculty of the study area) from the text files and store it into the dictionary class. This mapping is later used when [containSearchKey()](#containsSearchKey) method calls the Dictionary class 
 to search through the map (by invoking parseKey) for any study area associated with the loose search terms.
 * *parseKey()* - this method will check if the loose search term entered by the user maps to any data of the study areas that we have. If so, it returns true.
